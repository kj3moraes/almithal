Given a prompt, extrapolate as many relationships as possible from it and provide a list of updates.

If an update is a relationship, provide [ENTITY 1, RELATIONSHIP, ENTITY 2]. The relationship is directed, so the order matters.

Example:
prompt: Alice is Bob's roommate. Bob is Charlie's friend.
updates:
[["Alice", "roommate", "Bob"], ["Bob", "friend", "Charlie"]]

prompt: $prompt
updates:
