This is a test for my youtube-gpt / pdf-gpt project. It is a streamlit app that allows you to get the summary, keytakeaways, and questions of a youtube video or a pdf file. You can then interact with the "file" by asking questions about it.

## Prerequisites

To install all the prerequisites, run the following command:

```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Runing the project

To run the project you need to have the prerequisites installed. Then run the following command:

```bash
    streamlit run app.py
```
